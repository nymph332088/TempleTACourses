\maketitle

\paragraph*{\bf Question 1}
Let $X$ be a discrete random variable with Probability Mass Function $p$ is given by: \\
\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|cccc} \hline
a & -1 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\ \hline
p(a) & $\frac{1}{6}$ & $\frac{1}{6}$ & $\frac{1}{3}$ & $\frac{1}{3}$ \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
%\caption{The probability mass function of X}
\label{ta1}
\end{center}
\end{table}
\\ and p(a)=0 for all other a. 

\subparagraph*{a.} Let the random variable Y be defined by $Y=X^2$, i.e., if X = 2, then Y = 4. Calculate the probability mass function of Y. 
\subparagraph*{b.} Calculate the value of the distribution function of X and Y in a = 1, a = $\frac{3}{4}$, and $a=\pi - 3$. 


\paragraph*{\bf Question 2}
Suppose that the distribution function of a discrete random variable X is given by 
\begin{align*}
F(a) = \left\{ 
\begin{array}{rcl}
0 & \mbox{for} & a < 0\\
\frac{1}{3} & \mbox{for} & 0 \leq a < \frac{1}{2} \\
\frac{2}{3} & \mbox{for} & \frac{1}{2} \leq a < \frac{3}{4} \\
1 & \mbox{for} & a \geq \frac{3}{4}.
\end{array} \right.
\end{align*}
Determine the probability mass function of X. 

\vspace{8em}
\paragraph*{\bf Question 3}
You toss n coins, each showing heads with probability p, independently of the other tosses. Each coin that shows tails is tossed again once. Let X be the total number of heads. 

\subparagraph*{a.} What type of distribution does X have? Specify its parameter(s). 
\subparagraph*{b.} What is the probability mass function of the total number of heads X?

\paragraph*{\bf Question 4}
You decide to play monthly in two different lotteries, and you stop playing as soon as you win a prize in one (or both) lotteries of
at least one million dollars. Suppose that every time you participate in these lotteries, the probability to win at least one million dollars is $p_1$ for one of the lotteries and $p_2$ for the other. Let $M$ be the number of times you participate in these lotteries until winning at least one prize. What kind of distribution does $M$ have, and what is its parameter?

\paragraph*{\bf Question 5}
We throw a coin until a head turns up for the second time, where $p$ is the probability that a throw results in a head and we assume
that the outcome of each throw is independent of the previous outcomes. Let $X$ be the number of times we have thrown the coin.
\subparagraph*{a.} Determine $P(X = 2), P(X = 3)$, and $P(X = 4)$.
\subparagraph*{b.} Show that $P(X = n) = (n - 1)p^2(1-p)^{n-2},$ for $n \ge 2.$
