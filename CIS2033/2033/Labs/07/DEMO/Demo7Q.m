%Q1: Load Demo7a.mat, which contains a instance matrix X1 (n*p) and a vector Y1 (n*1). 
% For the instance matrix X1, each row stands for one instance 
% and each column stands for one attribute. 
% For the vector Y1, the i-th entry stands for the response for the i-th instance (X(i,:)). 
% Suppose there is a linear regression model between the attributes and the response. 
% Please use least squares estimation to estimate the model paramaters w. 
% Please also compute the residuals and the summed square of residuals. 


%Q2: Please load Demo7b.mat, which contains 500 new instances stored in the
%instance matrix X2. 
% Please use the linear regression model computed from previous questions
% to predict their reponses. 
% Please compare the predicted response of the true response (Y2) for each
% instance. 
% Please also compute the sum of least square errors.
