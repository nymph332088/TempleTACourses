1. 
Let Z be the number of times a 6 appeared in five independent throws of a die. Describe the probability distribution of Z by:
   Plotting the probability mass function P(Z) and
   Plotting the cumulative distribution function F(Z) of Z

2.
Plot the probability mass function and the cumulative distribution function of a binomial distribution for a few different values of the parameter p. How does the shape change as a function of p?

Plot the probability mass function and the cumulative distribution function of a geometric distribution for a few different values of the parameter p. How does the shape change as a function of p?
