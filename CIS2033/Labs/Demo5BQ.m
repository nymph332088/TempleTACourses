% Ex 1: load poiss.mat. 
% Let the discrete random variable X be the number of customers visiting
% ABC Bank in a hour. We know that X ~ Poiss(lambda). 
% The poiss.mat stores such information: 1000 records. 
% 1.1 Estimate lambda;
% 1.2 Compute P(X=k), k = minK, minK+1, minK+2, ..., maxK, where minK and maxK
% are the minimum and maximum of X, respectively;
% 1.3 Estimate P(X=k) by using the frequencies. 
% 1.4 Plot 2D figure with both results from 1.2 and 1.3: two curves;


% Ex 2: load norm.mat. 
% Let the continuous random variable X be the price changes of the product XYZ. 
% Positve values mean its price is increased and negative values mean its
% price is decreased. 
% We know that X ~ N(mu, sigma^2). 
% The norm.mat stores 1000 records of such information. 
% Please load the data and 
% 2.1) Estimate mu and sigma;
% 2.2) Compute P(X=a), a belongs to [minX, maxX] where minX and maxX are
% the minimum and maximum of X, respectively. 
% 2.3) Plot a 2D figure.
